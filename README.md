# LessOrMore
A little game developped in python in 1 week while my stage for fune when I had nothing to do

Started with a game with only difficulty options and was used in the terminal

But the second day of my stage, someone said "Oh it could be cool with a graphical interface" so, there's it is !
Learned a lot on graphical interfaces with tkinter, and remembered me many things about object coding.
